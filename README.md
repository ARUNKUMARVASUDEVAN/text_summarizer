# Text_summarizer_Project
![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/zenml)

**Problem statement**: to create a model to short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document. Automatic text summarization are greatly needed to address the ever-growing amount of text data available online. This could help to discover relevant information and to consume relevant information faster. We will be using [samsum text summarization dataset ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum). This dataset has the information about 16k messenger-like conversations with summaries. Conversations were created and written down by linguists fluent in English .The style and register are diversified - conversations could be informal, semi-formal or formal, they may contain slang words, emoticons and typos. Then, the conversations were annotated with summaries. It was assumed that summaries should be a concise brief of what people talked about in the conversation in third person. The objective here is to summarize the given text for easy and simple understanding.we will be use [ML flow](https://mlflow.org/) to build a production level pipeline in order to summarize.


The purpose of this repository is to build summarizer using [hugging face transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)

  -Feature engineering and EDA of the data.

  -Using [google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail).
  
  -Writing clean code.

  -Integrating ML flow.
